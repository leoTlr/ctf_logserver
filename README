Logserver

build:
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
-> if it is already built once and you just patched sth only do make in build dir

if you run it for the first time you can use init.sh 
this will generate the rsa keys, make required directories and build the executable
-> if there already is a logfile or rsa key dir this is already done and you dont need to run this

There is no frontend.
Either use provided client or pipe requests into nc:
$ ./server 65333 ./pub_key.pem ./priv_key.pem &  
$ cat logfile | logserver_client.py sendlogs some_user 127.0.0.1 65333
$ logserver_client.py getlogs some_user 127.0.0.1 65333
$ logserver_client.py showtoken some_user
$ printf "GET /some_user HTTP/1.1\r\nAuthorization: Bearer j.w.t\_\r\n\r\n" | nc 127.0.0.1 65333
